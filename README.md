# The Sprawl Tax

This visualization dashboard aims to visualize the negative externalities of urban sprawl.

The costs associated with sprawl include:

- Increased maintenance costs
- Increased sedentariness
- Increased illness associated with air pollution
- Fiscal unsustainability

This dashboard aims to allow the user to view the extent of urban sprawl under a variety of zoning situations, from no zoning, to single family detached only, as is standard across much of the United States.

The area in question is the Atlanta Metro area, specifically Fulton, Gwinnett, and Dekalb counties, for which robust zoning data could be found.

# Data Sources

Quite a few of the data sources are very large, so rather than storing them in Git LFS, I have opted to hold it in a Dropbox.
